--------------------
Introduction
--------------------

This is the README file for a debugger for Tcl and Tk applications.
This is a release for Tcl 8.3.  (It has not been tested with Tcl 8.2
and it does not work with 8.0 or earlier (for Tcl-7.5, 7.6, and 8.0
get tcl-debug-1.9).  This is not guaranteed to work with alpha or beta
releases of Tcl.  This is compatible with any Tcl extension that does
not make changes to Tcl itself.

This is a debugger in the traditional style.  It is patterned after
gdb and dbx.  For example, you can give commands such as "s" to step
into a procedure, "c" to continue, and "b" to set a breakpoint.

-------------------
Starting the Debugger
-------------------

There are several ways of starting the debugger.

1) Dynamically

   If you already have an existing session, use the package command:

   % package require Dbg

   (If this isn't an interactive session, send the command from another
   interpreter!)

2) Statically in Expect or Expectk

   Get a tool that already has it installed, such as Expect.  Expect
   is just tclsh plus the Expect commands plus the debugger commands.
   (Just ignore the Expect commands.)  Why would you want to do this?
   Several reasons:

      2.1) You don't have dynamic loading enabled
      2.2) You need to debug starting before the first line in your
           script.

   If you want to debug Tk programs, use Expectk (this comes with
   Expect) which is just wish + Expect + Debugger.

   You can ftp Expect from ftp.cme.nist.gov as pub/expect/expect.tar.Z.

3) Statically in another Tcl application

    It is very easy to drop the debugger into existing Tcl and Tk
    applications - just add a call to Tcldbg_Init(interp) and you get a
    "debug" command that starts the debugger.  The INSTALL file mentions
    other possible ways of configuring the debugger.

Documentation
--------------------

This distribution includes the paper "A Debugger for Tcl
Applications", Proceedings of the Tcl/Tk '93 Workshop, June 10-11,
Berkeley, CA.  This paper includes a brief tutorial for users, and a
description of the C interface for Tcl application authors.

A few things have changed since the paper was written but not much.
See the CHANGES file for more info.

A tutorial and complete description of the debugger can be found in
Exploring Expect, ISBN 1-56592-090-2, published by O'Reilly.

How to Get the Documentation or the Latest Version of the Debugger
--------------------

The debugger may be ftp'd as pub/expect/tcl-debug.tar.Z from
ftp.cme.nist.gov.  Request email delivery by mailing to
"library@cme.nist.gov".  The contents of the message should be (no
subject line) "send pub/expect/tcl-debug.tar.Z".

Once you have retrieved the system, read the INSTALL file.  The paper
mentioned above can be retrieved separately as:

  pub/expect/tcl-debug.ps.Z          (Tcl/Tk '93 - Tcl/Tk Debugger)

The overhead transparencies I used at the Tcl/Tk conference is also
available in the same way as the paper itself.  The transparencies are
sketchy and not meant for personal education - however if you are
familiar with the debugger and just want to give a short talk on it to
your colleagues, you may find the transparencies useful.  It is
intended for a 15-20 minute talk.

  pub/expect/tcl-debug-talk.ps.Z     (Tcl/Tk '93 - Tcl/Tk Debugger)

All of the documents are compressed PostScript files and should be
uncompressed and sent to a PostScript printer.  The documents are
intended for printing at 8.5"x11" and may fail on some ISO A4
printers.  According to Hans Mayer <Hans.Mayer@gmd.de>, you can make
it A4-able by searching for "FMVERSION" and changing the next line
from:

	1 1 0 0 612 792 0 1 13 FMDOCUMENT
to:
	1 1 0 0 594 841 0 1 13 FMDOCUMENT

Support
--------------------

Although I can't promise anything in the way of support, I'd be
interested to hear about your experiences using it (either good or
bad).  I'm also interested in hearing bug reports (please include
version #) and suggestions for improvement even though I can't promise
to implement them immediately.

Awards, love letters, and bug reports may be sent to:

Design and implementation of this program was paid for by U.S. tax
dollars.  Therefore it is public domain.  However, the author and NIST
would appreciate credit if this program or parts of it are used.
