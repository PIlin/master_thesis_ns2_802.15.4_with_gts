<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>IV. The first Tcl script</H1>

In this section, you are going to develop a Tcl script for ns which 
simulates a simple topology. You are going to learn how to set up
nodes and links, how to send data from one node to another, how to
monitor a queue and how to start nam from your simulation script to
visualize your simulation.
</P>

<STRONG>IV.1. How to start</STRONG><BR>
Now we are going to write a 'template' that you can use for
all of the first Tcl scripts. You can write your Tcl scripts in
any text editor like joe or emacs. I suggest that you call this
first example 'example1.tcl'.
</P>
<P>
First of all, you need to create a simulator object. This is done with
the command
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

set ns [new Simulator]</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>
<P>
Now we open a file for writing that is going to be used for the
nam trace data.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

set nf [open out.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $nf
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>

The first line opens the file 'out.nam' for writing and gives it
the file handle 'nf'. In the second line we tell the simulator object
that we created above to write all simulation data that is going to be
relevant for nam into this file.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to add a 'finish' procedure that closes the trace
file and starts nam.

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

proc finish {} {
        global ns nf
        $ns flush-trace
        close $nf
        exec nam out.nam &
        exit 0
}
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>

You don't really have to understand all of the above code yet. It will
get clearer to you once you see what the code does.
</P>
<P>
The next line tells the simulator object to execute the 'finish'
procedure after 5.0 seconds of simulation time.

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

$ns at 5.0 "finish"
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>

You probably understand what this line does just by looking at it.
ns provides you with a very simple way to schedule events with the 
'at' command.
</P>
<P>
The last line finally starts the simulation.

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

$ns run
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>

</P>
<P>
You can actually save the file now and try to run it with 
'ns example1.tcl'. You are going to get an error message like
'nam: empty trace file out.nam' though, because until now we haven't
defined any objects (nodes, links, etc.) or events. We are going to
define the objects in <A HREF="#second">section 2</A> and the events
in <A HREF="#third">section 3</A>.
</P>
<P>
You will have to use the code from this section as starting point
in the other sections. You can download it <A HREF="examples/template.tcl">here</A>.
</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="second"> 
<P> 
<STRONG>IV.2. Two nodes, one link</STRONG><BR> 
In this section we are going to define a very simple topology with two
nodes that are connected by a link. The following two lines define
the two nodes. (Note: You have to insert the code in this section
<STRONG>before</STRONG> the line '$ns run', or even better, before the
line '$ns at 5.0 "finish"').

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

set n0 [$ns node]
set n1 [$ns node]
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>

A new node object is created with the command '$ns node'. The
above code creates two nodes and assigns them to the handles 'n0' and
'n1'. 
</P>
<P>
The next line connects the two nodes.

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

$ns duplex-link $n0 $n1 1Mb 10ms DropTail
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>

This line tells the simulator object to connect the nodes n0 and n1
with a duplex link with the bandwidth 1Megabit, a delay of 10ms and a
DropTail queue.
</P>
<P>
Now you can save your file and start the script with 'ns example1.tcl'.
nam will be started automatically and you should see an output that
resembles the picture below.

if it doesn't work for you and you think you might have made a mistake.

<STRONG>IV.3 Sending data</STRONG><BR>
Of course, this example isn't very satisfying yet, since you can only look at
the topology, but nothing actually happens, so the next step is to send
some data from node n0 to node n1. In ns, data is always being sent from one
'agent' to another. So the next step is to create an agent object that sends
data from node n0, and another agent object that receives the data on node
n1.

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>
#Create a UDP agent and attach it to node n0
set udp0 [new Agent/UDP]
$ns attach-agent $n0 $udp0

# Create a CBR traffic source and attach it to udp0
set cbr0 [new Application/Traffic/CBR]
$cbr0 set packetSize_ 500
$cbr0 set interval_ 0.005
$cbr0 attach-agent $udp0
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>
<P>
These lines create a UDP agent and attach it to the node n0, then attach a CBR 
traffic generatot to the UDP agent. CBR stands for
'constant bit rate'. Line 7 and 8 should be self-explaining.
The packetSize is being set to 500 bytes and a packet will be sent every
0.005 seconds (i.e. 200 packets per second). You can find the relevant
parameters for each agent type in the 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/doc/index.html">ns manual page</A><BR>
</P>
<P>
The next lines create a Null agent which acts as traffic sink and attach it to 
node n1.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

set null0 [new Agent/Null] 
$ns attach-agent $n1 $null0
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>
<P>
Now the two agents have to be connected with each other.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

$ns connect $udp0 $null0
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>
<P>
And now we have to tell the CBR agent when to send data and when to stop sending. 
Note: It's probably best to put the following lines just before the line
'$ns at 5.0 "finish"'.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

$ns at 0.5 "$cbr0 start"
$ns at 4.5 "$cbr0 stop"
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
This code should be self-explaining again.
</P>
<P>
Now you can save the file and start the simulation again. When you click on
the 'play' button in the nam window, you will see that after 0.5 simulation
seconds, node 0 starts sending data packets to node 1. You might want to slow
nam down then with the 'Step' slider.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/namss3.gif" WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=199 ALT="Nam snap shot">
</P>
<P>
I suggest that now you start some experiments with nam and the Tcl script.
You can click on any packet in the nam window to monitor it, and you can also
click directly on the link to get some graphs with statistics. I also suggest 
that you try to change the 'packetsize_' and 'interval_' parameters in the
Tcl script to see what happens. You can download the full example 
<A HREF="examples/example1b.tcl">here</A>.
</P>

<P>
Most of the information that I needed to be able to write this Tcl script
was taken directly from the example files in the 'tcl/ex/' directory, while
I learned which CBR agent arguments (packetSize_, interval_) I had to set from
the <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/doc/index.html">ns manual page</A>.
