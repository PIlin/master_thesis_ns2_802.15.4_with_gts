<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>VII. A new protocol for ns</H1>

<P>
[<A HREF="nsscript3.html">Previous section</A>]
[<A HREF="nsindex.html">Back to the index</A>]
[<A HREF="nsscript4.html">Next section</A>]
</P>

<P>
In this section I will give you an example for a new protocol that could
be implemented in ns. You should probably become fairly familiar with ns
before you try this yourself, and some C++ knowledge is definitely 
necessary. You should also read at least the chapters 3.1-3.3 from
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-documentation.html">"ns Notes
and Documentation" (now renamed ns Manual)</A> to understand the
interaction between Tcl and C++.
</P>

<P>
The code in this section implements some sort of simple 'ping' protocol
(inspired by the 'ping requestor' in chapter 9.6 of the
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-documentation.html">"ns Notes
and Documentation" (now renamed ns Manual)</A>, but fairly different). One
node will be able to
send a packet to another node which will return it immediately, so that
the round-trip-time can be calculated.
</P>

<P>
I understand that the code presented here might not be the best 
possible implementation, and I am sure it can be improved, though I hope 
it is easy to understand, which is the main priority here. However, 
suggestions can be sent <A HREF="mailto:ns-users@isi.edu">here</A>.

<STRONG>VII.1. The header file</STRONG><BR>
In the new header file 'ping.h' we first have to declare the data structure 
for the new Ping packet header which is going to carry the relevant data.

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

struct hdr_ping {
  char ret;
  double send_time;
};
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
The char 'ret' is going to be set to '0' if the packet is on its way from
the sender to the node which is being pinged, while it is going to be set
to '1' on its way back. The double 'send_time' is a time stamp that is set
on the packet when it is sent, and which is later used to calculate the
round-trip-time.
</P>

<P>
The following piece of code declares the class 'PingAgent' as a subclass
of the class 'Agent'.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>
class PingAgent : public Agent {
 public:
  PingAgent();
  int command(int argc, const char*const* argv);
  void recv(Packet*, Handler*);
 protected:
  int off_ping_;  
};
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
In the following section, I am going to present the C++ code which
defines the constructor 'PingAgent()' and the functions 'command()' and
'recv()' which were redefined in this declaration. The int 'off_ping_'
will be used to access a packet's ping header. Note that for variables
with a local object scope usually a trailing '_' is used.
</P>

<P>
You can download the full header file <A HREF="examples/ping.h">here</A>
(I suggest you do that and take a quick look at it, since the code that
was presented here isn't totally complete).
</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="second">
<P>
<STRONG>VII.2. The C++ code</STRONG><BR>
First the linkage between the C++ code and Tcl code has to be defined.
It is not necessary that you fully understand this code, but it would help
you to read the chapters 3.1-3.3 in the
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-documentation.html">"ns Manual"</A> if you
haven't done that yet to understand it. 
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

static class PingHeaderClass : public PacketHeaderClass {
public:
  PingHeaderClass() : PacketHeaderClass("PacketHeader/Ping", 
                                        sizeof(hdr_ping)) {}
} class_pinghdr;


static class PingClass : public TclClass {
public:
  PingClass() : TclClass("Agent/Ping") {}
  TclObject* create(int, const char*const*) {
    return (new PingAgent());
  }
} class_ping;
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
The next piece of code is the constructor for the class 'PingAgent'.
It binds the variables which have to be accessed both in Tcl and C++.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

PingAgent::PingAgent() : Agent(PT_PING)
{
  bind("packetSize_", &size_);
  bind("off_ping_", &off_ping_);
}
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>
<P>
The function 'command()' is called when a Tcl command for the
class 'PingAgent' is executed. In our case that would be
'$pa send' (assuming 'pa' is an instance of the Agent/Ping class),
because we want to send ping packets from the Agent to another
ping agent. You basically have to parse the command in the
'command()' function, and if no match is found, you have to
pass the command with its arguments to the 'command()' function
of the base class (in this case 'Agent::command()'). The code
might look very long because it's commented heavily.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

int PingAgent::command(int argc, const char*const* argv)
{
  if (argc == 2) {
    if (strcmp(argv[1], "send") == 0) {
      // Create a new packet
      Packet* pkt = allocpkt();
      // Access the Ping header for the new packet:
      hdr_ping* hdr = (hdr_ping*)pkt->access(off_ping_);
      // Set the 'ret' field to 0, so the receiving node knows
      // that it has to generate an echo packet
      hdr->ret = 0;
      // Store the current time in the 'send_time' field
      hdr->send_time = Scheduler::instance().clock();
      // Send the packet
      send(pkt, 0);
      // return TCL_OK, so the calling function knows that the
      // command has been processed
      return (TCL_OK);
    }
  }
  // If the command hasn't been processed by PingAgent()::command,
  // call the command() function for the base class
  return (Agent::command(argc, argv));
}
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
The function 'recv()' defines the actions to be taken when a
packet is received. If the 'ret' field is 0, a packet with the
same value for the 'send_time' field, but with the 'ret' field set
to 1 has to be returned. If 'ret' is 1, a Tcl function (which has
to be defined by the user in Tcl) is called and processed the
event (Important note to users of the ns version 2.1b2:
'Address::instance().NodeShift_[1]' has to be replaced with 'NODESHIFT' 
to get the example to work under ns 2.1b2).
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

void PingAgent::recv(Packet* pkt, Handler*)
{
  // Access the IP header for the received packet:
  hdr_ip* hdrip = (hdr_ip*)pkt->access(off_ip_);
  // Access the Ping header for the received packet:
  hdr_ping* hdr = (hdr_ping*)pkt->access(off_ping_);
  // Is the 'ret' field = 0 (i.e. the receiving node is being pinged)?
  if (hdr->ret == 0) {
    // Send an 'echo'. First save the old packet's send_time
    double stime = hdr->send_time;
    // Discard the packet
    Packet::free(pkt);
    // Create a new packet
    Packet* pktret = allocpkt();    
    // Access the Ping header for the new packet:
    hdr_ping* hdrret = (hdr_ping*)pktret->access(off_ping_);
    // Set the 'ret' field to 1, so the receiver won't send another echo
    hdrret->ret = 1;                
    // Set the send_time field to the correct value
    hdrret->send_time = stime;      
    // Send the packet              
    send(pktret, 0);                
  } else {                          
    // A packet was received. Use tcl.eval to call the Tcl
    // interpreter with the ping results.
    // Note: In the Tcl code, a procedure 'Agent/Ping recv {from rtt}'
    // has to be defined which allows the user to react to the ping
    // result.                      
    char out[100];                  
    // Prepare the output to the Tcl interpreter. Calculate the round
    // trip time                    
    sprintf(out, "%s recv %d %3.1f", name(), 
            hdrip->src_.addr_ >> Address::instance().NodeShift_[1],
            (Scheduler::instance().clock()-hdr->send_time) * 1000);
    Tcl& tcl = Tcl::instance();     
    tcl.eval(out);                  
    // Discard the packet           
    Packet::free(pkt);              
  }                                 
}                                   
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
You can download the full file <A HREF="examples/ping.cc">here</A>.
The most interesting part should be the 'tcl.eval()' function where a
Tcl function 'recv' is called, with the id of the pinged node and the 
round-trip-time (in miliseconds) as parameters. It will be shown in
<A HREF="fourth">Section VII.4</A> how the code for this function has to
be written. But first of all, some other files have to be edited before
ns can be recompiled.
</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="third">
<P>
<STRONG>VII.3. Necessary changes</STRONG><BR>
</P>

<P>
You will have to change some things in some of the ns source files if
you want to add a new agent, especially if it uses a new packet format.
I suggest you always mark your changes with comments, use #ifdef, etc.,
so you can easily remove your changes or port them to new ns releases.
</P>

<P>
We're going to need a new packet type for the ping agent, so the first
step is to edit the file 'packet.h'. There you can find the definitions
for the packet protocol IDs (i.e. PT_TCP, PT_TELNET, etc.). Add a new
definition for PT_PING there. In my
edited version of packet.h, the last few lines of enum packet_t {} looks like
the following code (it might look a bit different in earlier/later releases).
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>
enum packet_t {
	PT_TCP,
	PT_UDP,
        ......
	// insert new packet types here
	PT_TFRC,
	PT_TFRC_ACK,
        PT_PING,    //  packet protocol ID for our ping-agent
	PT_NTYPE // This MUST be the LAST one
};

</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
You also have to edit the p_info() in the same file to include "Ping".
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

class p_info {
public:
	p_info() {
		name_[PT_TCP]= "tcp";
		name_[PT_UDP]= "udp";
                ...........
 		name_[PT_TFRC]= "tcpFriend";
		name_[PT_TFRC_ACK]= "tcpFriendCtl";

                name_[PT_PING]="Ping";

		name_[PT_NTYPE]= "undefined";
	}
        .....
 }
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
Remember that you have to do a 'make depend' before you do the 'make', 
otherwise these two files might not be recompiled.
</P>

<P>
The file 'tcl/lib/ns-default.tcl' has to be edited too. This is the
file where all default values for the Tcl objects are defined. Insert
the following line to set the default packet size for Agent/Ping.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

Agent/Ping set packetSize_ 64
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
You also have to add an entry for the new ping packets in the file
'tcl/lib/ns-packet.tcl' in the list at the beginning of the file. It
would look like the following piece of code.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

        { SRMEXT off_srm_ext_}
        { Ping off_ping_ }} {
set cl PacketHeader/[lindex $pair 0]
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
The last change is a change that has to be applied to the 'Makefile'.
You have to add the file 'ping.o' to the list of object files for ns.
In my version the last lines of the edited list look like this:
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

sessionhelper.o delaymodel.o srm-ssm.o \
srm-topo.o \
ping.o \
$(LIB_DIR)int.Vec.o $(LIB_DIR)int.RVec.o \
$(LIB_DIR)dmalloc_support.o \
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
</P>

<P>
You should be able to recompile ns now simply by typing 'make' in
the ns directory. If you are having any problems, please
<A HREF="mailto:ns-users@isi.edu">email ns-users</A>.
</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="fourth">
<P>
<STRONG>VII.4. The Tcl code</STRONG><BR>
I'm not going to present the full code for a Tcl example for
the Ping agent now. You can download a full example 
<A HREF="examples/ping.tcl">here</A>. But I will show you how
to write the 'recv' procedure that is called from the 'recv()'
function in the C++ code when a ping 'echo' packet is received.
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#eeeeee" CELLPADDING=5><TD><CODE><PRE>

Agent/Ping instproc recv {from rtt} {
        $self instvar node_
        puts "node [$node_ id] received ping answer from \
              $from with round-trip-time $rtt ms."
}
</PRE></CODE></TD></TABLE>
This code should be fairly easy to understand. The only new thing
is that it accesses the member variable 'node_' of the base class
'Agent' to get the node id for the node the agent is attached to.
</P>

<P>
Now you can try some experiments of your own. A very simple experiment
would be to <STRONG>not</STRONG> set the 'ret' field in the packets
to 1. You can probably guess what is going to happen. You can also try
to add some code that allows the user to send ping packets with
'$pa send $node' (where 'pa' is a ping agent and 'node' a node) without
having to connect the agent 'pa' with the ping agent on 'node' first,
though that might be a little bit more complicated than it sounds at
first. You can also read the chapter 9.6 from the
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-documentation.html">"ns Manual"</A> to learn
more about creating your own agents. 
<STRONG>Good luck</STRONG>.
